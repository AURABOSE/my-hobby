      <p>My favourite hobby is reading and writing.It is my favourite way to pass time as I enjoy the different stories,genres and characters.My favourite book to "Miss peregrine's home for peculier children" and "malory towers" series.I enjoy the first one as these children have interesting yet unique powers. I enjoy the second one as they always play pranks and study and have normal lives.</p>
